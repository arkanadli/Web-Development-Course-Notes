npm or Node Package Manager are 2 things basically:
1. it is bunch of package that other user already code that we can install to use it in our project

2. npm already bundled in our node, so we can call syntax npm to use the method!!

Install other npm :
theres 2 different scope, we install it in global(-g) and locally(in the node module folder).
usually we install it in global when we need npm for syntax in git bash editor.

when the global npm want we use in the current dir, we can use 
npm link {npm.title} // example npm link cowsay
